# Spacebook-Client

This project is coursework for 3rd year uni.

A team working on a hypothetical social network 'Spacebook' have an existing web-application tha interacts with a RESTful API.
They have asked for the development of a frontend in the form of a mobile app.

This was the first time I had used github, or any form of version control. While it was very helpful, I am aware my use of it did not conform to best practices.
